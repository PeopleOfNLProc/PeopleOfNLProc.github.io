    "body": "People of Natural Language Processing (#PeopleOfNLProc) was started by NAACL-HLT 2021 Publicity Co-chairs Sarah Wiegreffe, Enrico Santus, and Peng Qi, originally as part of an effort to promote the conference and help connect the natural language processing research community in a time of virtual conferences. Want to see yourself featured on #PeopleOfNLProc? Read on. . . : Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this the NAACL Publicity Chairs are starting a new series called #PeopleOfNLProc on the NAACL social media channels and the official NAACL conference blog! For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE. Anyone is welcome to participate ‚Äì fill out the Google form here: https://forms. gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8 Meet the people behind #PeopleOfNLProc:               Sarah WiegreffeFollow    Sarah Wiegreffe is a PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech, where she is advised by Professor Mark Riedl. Before joining Georgia Tech, she received her B. S. in Data Science from the College of Charleston. Her research is on analyzing and developing interpretable deep learning models for NLP.                 Enrico SantusFollow    Enrico¬†Santus is a Data Science Leader in Pharmacovigilance at Bayer. After his PhD at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University,¬†Enrico¬†joined the group of Regina Barzilay at¬†CSAIL, MIT. His academic career includes affiliations with the King's College of London, the University of Pisa, the University of Stuttgart, the Nara Institute of Technology and Harvard. His work touches topics such as NLP in Oncology, Cardiology and Palliative Care. ¬†Enrico¬†has also worked on Epidemiology, Fake News Detection, Sentiment Analysis and Lexical Semantics.                 Peng QiFollow    Peng Qi is a researcher at JD AI Research working on natural language processing and machine learning. Before joining JD, he obtained my Ph. D. in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by Prof. Chris Manning, where he was a member of the natural language processing group. Peng's research focuses on explainable machine learning systems to help us solve problems efficiently using textual knowledge. He is also one of the lead developers of the popular NLP toolkit Stanza.   "
