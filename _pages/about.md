<p>People of Natural Language Processing (#PeopleOfNLProc) was started by <a href="https://2021.naacl.org/">NAACL-HLT 2021</a> Publicity Co-chairs Sarah Wiegreffe, Enrico Santus, and Peng Qi, originally as part of an effort to promote the conference and help connect the natural language processing research community in a time of virtual conferences.</p>

<h4>Want to see yourself featured on #PeopleOfNLProc? Read on...</h4>

<p>Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this the NAACL Publicity Chairs are starting a new series called #PeopleOfNLProc on the NAACL social media channels and <a href="https://2021.naacl.org/blog">the official NAACL conference blog</a>!</p>

<p>For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via <strong>TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE</strong>. Anyone is welcome to participate – fill out the Google form here: <a href="https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8">https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8</a></p>
