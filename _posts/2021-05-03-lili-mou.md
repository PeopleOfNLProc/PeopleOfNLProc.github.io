**BIO:** I am an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, and I am also an Amii Fellow and CIFAR AI Chair. I obtained my BS and PhD degrees from Peking University, and did my postdoc at the University of Waterloo. I am mainly interested in machine learning approaches to NLP.

Which of the next 3 facts about Vered is the lie?

1. We admit very few grads due to funding limit.
2. My rental apartment is 2min walk from campus.
3. I did my PhD in Software Engineering Institute.
