**BIO:** I am a CS Ph.D. candidate at UCSC. I am broadly interested in controlled text generation and social commonsense reasoning. I am currently working on teaching machines to generate coherent and engaging narratives. I enjoy photography, traveling, and authentic foods. 

Which of the next 3 facts about Faeze is the lie?

1. My mother was my teacher at school.
2. My parents have never seen my husband.
3. I have a twin bro sharing same name as my husband.
