**BIO:** I live in Seattle and work at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI. Some of the things Iâ€™ve worked on recently include: language modeling, NLP for scientific text, evaluation, MT, and theoretical analysis of NLP models.

Which of the next 3 facts about Noah is the lie?

1. I ran a half-marathon distance one day in 2020.
2. I converted my guest bathroom to a gin distillery.
3. I performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival.
