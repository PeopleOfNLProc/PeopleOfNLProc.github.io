**BIO:** I'm a Research Scientist at Amazon, did my Ph.D. at Bar Ilan University. In my research I focus on multilinguality and gender bias in NLP, two topics I find fascinating and important.

1. I saw a Tasmanian devil in the wild.
2. I dived in the Great Barrier Reef.
3. I got injured when bungee jumping.
