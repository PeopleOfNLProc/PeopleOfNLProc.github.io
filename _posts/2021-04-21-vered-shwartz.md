**BIO:** I'm a postdoc at AI2 and the University of Washington. I got my PhD from Bar-Ilan University. Besides research, I like to work out, feed birds, and listen to audiobooks. I'm interested in computational semantics and pragmatics, and commonsense reasoning. I'm currently working on learning to uncover implicit meaning, which is abundant in human speech, and on developing machines with advanced reasoning skills.

Which of the next 3 facts about Vered is the lie?

1. I did my PhD to prove to my parents that I DO finish what I start.
2. My husband and I started dating in 2004.
3. I co-authored a paper with my brother.
