**BIO:** I am an associate professor at National Taiwan University (NTU). Recently, I am particularly interested in self-supervised learning for speech. Some people think I am a Pokémon Master (this is a true fact) because I used examples related to Pokémon in my machine learning courses.

Which of the next 3 facts about Hung-yi is the lie?

1. I own a YT channel with more than 80k subscribers.
2. It took me a week to come up with the facts.
3. I plan to use TTS to give a talk in NAACL 2021.
