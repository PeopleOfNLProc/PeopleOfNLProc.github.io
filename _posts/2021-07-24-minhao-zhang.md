**BIO:** I'm an undergraduate at Peking University majoring in Computer Science. Currently, my research focus on NLP applications on KB, including QA, NER, etc. However, I’m still a novice in NLP and I’d be happy to try out more interesting topics. For hobbies, I (very much) love birding.

Which of the next 3 facts about Minhao is the lie?

1. Though majoring in CS, I'm not in EECS department.
2. I've seen nearly 800 species of birds in China.
3. Besides NLP, I'm also interested in economics.
